# MNIST TensorFlow PoC

## Introduction
This is a Proof of Concept (PoC) project demonstrating a basic implementation of a neural network model using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Setup Instructions
1. Install the required packages: `pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy`.
2. Run the script: `python poc.py --epochs 10`.

## Usage
- `--epochs`: Number of epochs for training the model (default is 10).

## Purpose
This PoC aims to provide a clear understanding and a basic implementation of a neural network model using TensorFlow.

## Results Explanation
After running, the program will display plots showing the model's performance and accuracy and logs will be written to `mnist_poc.log`.

## Known Limitations
- This is a basic implementation and does not include advanced optimizations or tuning.
- The model architecture is simple and can be expanded for more complex tasks.

## Future Improvements
- Implementation of advanced optimization techniques.
- Addition of more layers and neurons to increase model complexity.
- Enhancements in logging and result representation for more in-depth analysis.
